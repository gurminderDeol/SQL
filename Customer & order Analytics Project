#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT Count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Febsale
ON customer.order_id=Febsale.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price = (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Group BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue
select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(distinct customer.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales febsale
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customer
ON febsale.orderid=customer.order_id
WHERE febsale.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
